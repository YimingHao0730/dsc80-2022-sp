Hello everyone, I am Murali, a Machine Learning and Data Science (MLDS) graduate student in ECE department at UCSD. I was born and raised in Vijayawada, India and completed my Bachelors from IIT Guwahati. I am excited to help students strengthen their applied DS knowledge through DSC 80 and connect it to real world DS for a pragmatic learning experience. Outside of class, I am an intermediate Pianist, usually learning western classical, and a dancer, trying to make videos on shuffling, freestyle and bollywood.
