Hi everyone! My name is Karthikeya and I am a third year Data Science major. I am originally from Hyderabad, India. This is my first time tutoring DSC 80 - I have tutored DSC 10 four times previously - so I am excited to tutor a class I enjoyed very much as a student. Outside of college work and data science, I watch a lot of sports, play tennis and enjoy going to the beach.
