Hi everyone, I'm from Mumbai, India and I'm graduating in Spring 2022 with a major in Data Science and minors in Mathematics and Entrepreneurship & Innovation. I have been an Instructional Assistant for nine quarters now, and this is my fifth time tutoring DSC 80. This class is extremely rewarding, so I would love to help you out so you can get the most out of it. When I'm not holding office hours at HDSI, you can catch me working out at RIMAC!
