Hello everyone! I'm Costin and I'm a 3rd year Data Science major from San Francisco. This will be my first time tutoring for DSC 80 so I am very excited to work with you in your journey through this class. When I have free time you can probably catch me playing some video games but I switch games so frequently that it would be hard to list them down. If you need help with the coming homeworks, want to talk DS, or any have other inquiries for me feel free to come to my office hours. Hope to see you there!
