Hey everyone! My name is Yash, I’m from the Bay Area, and I’m a third-year double majoring in Data Science and Cognitive Science. This is my first quarter tutoring DSC 80, although I've had experience tutoring DSC 10 four times. Outside of classes, I enjoy surfing, paddleboarding in Mission Bay, playing tennis, and exploring restaurants! I love mentoring and working with students, so I hope to see you in my OH!
