Hi everyone! I am a senior double majoring in Applied Math and Data Science from Guangzhou China. DSC 80 has been one of my favorites, since many skills acquired in this course are directly applicable to interviews and the industry. Besides, feel free to chat with me on ML, especially on Quantitative Investment topics. I have a lot of fun things about my recent intern to share.
